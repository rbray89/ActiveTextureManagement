### Global config settings
###  Modify this file to change global texture settings.
###  To manage a mod pack (more than just compress),
###  just add a config file with the exact name of the
###  mod's folder. Look in the same location as this 
###  config file for examples. In-depth settings and 
###  example overrides can be found below.

ACTIVE_TEXTURE_MANAGER
{

###DBG = TRUE
###Section for global settings
	
###  Sets how the shader filters textures. Options are:
###  	Point - No filtering is done. Pixels are sampled 
###           directly. Results in a "pixelated" object. 
###           Good for GUIs and other 2D applications
###   Bilinear - Decent filter. What KSP uses by default.	
###   Trilinear - Better filter. Sometimes difference is 
###           negligable. Will have small negative affect
###           on performace.
	filter_mode = Bilinear

###  Offload the texture from RAM into Graphics memory.
###   this will mean the textures cannot be sampled by 
###   the scripts, but saves a LOT of memory. MBMs are
###   not readable by default.  
	make_not_readable = true

###Section for non-normalmapped textures 
### Normal mapped textures are flagged as normal in MBMs,
### the file names end in _NRM, or are called out as such
### in the config files.

###  Compression flag. Compress all textures that
###   can be. This includes textures in packs that don't 
###   have config files. Will reduce quality slightly.
###   Not recomended for normal maps.
	compress = true

###  Generate mipmaps. Mipmaps add smaller, filtered versions
###   of the texture for use at a distance. Adds ~30% more 
###   memory. Well worth it on visual textures. 
	mipmaps = true

###  Resize the texture by the scale specified. Use powers
###   of two for best efficiency. 1 is no scalling, 2, is 1/2
###   4 is 1/4, etc.
	scale = 1

###  Specifies a maximum dimension for both width and height
###   of textures, AFTER any scalling. ie. if this is set to 
###   256, and you have a 1024X1024 texture and scale set to 2,
###   the resulting texture will be 256x256. Use it without 
###   scalling to only shrink larger textures. 
	max_size = 0
	min_size = 128

###  Section for normalmapped textures. Same as above, but
###   apply only to normal maps.
	compress_normals = true
	mipmaps_normals = true
	scale_normals = 2
	max_size_normals = 512

OVERRIDES
{
	.*/Props/.*
	{
		compress = true
		mipmaps = true
		scale = 1
		max_size = 0
	}
	
	.*/Flags/.*
	{
		compress = true
		mipmaps = false
		scale = 1
		max_size = 0
	}
	.*/Agencies/.*
	{
		compress = false
		mipmaps = false
		scale = 1
		max_size = 0
		make_not_readable = false
	}
}

### Specific sections can be added in config files
### to allow specifc behaviour. Examples shown are from
### Squad.cfg and BoulderCo.cfg.
###
### Some mods don't mark normal map textures properly,
### which can cause part errors.
### Specify the textures to be treaded as normal maps:
###NORMAL_LIST
###{
###	texture = Squad/Spaces/mk1CockpitInternal/model002
###	texture = Squad/Spaces/mk1CockpitInternal/model004
###	texture = Squad/Parts/FuelTank/RCSTank1-2/model001
###	texture = Squad/Parts/Aero/winglet2/model001
###}
###
### Override a specific file/folder using regexes(useful for flag/GUI folders)
### If any of the fields are ommitted, it is replaced by the global settings:
###OVERRIDES
###{
###	.*/Flags/.*
###	{
###		compress = true
###		mipmaps = false
###		scale = 1
###		max_size = 0
###		compress_normals = false
###		mipmaps_normals = false
###		scale_normals = 1
###		max_size_normals = 0
###		filtering = Bilinear
###		make_not_readable = true
###	}
###}
